          We have learned how to use time ranges with <code>SINCE</code> and{' '}

          We use <code>SINCE</code> and <code>UNTIL</code> to define our period
          of interest. Then, we denote the time period we'd like to compare
          against with a <code>COMPARE WITH [time period] AGO</code> clause

          To map the comparison of values over time, add <code>TIMESERIES</code>
          . This creates a line chart of the comparison, allowing you to
          visualize how this period compares to recent data, and track it over
          time.

          Comparisons can quickly answer questions about what's happening in
          your applications. Are different sales, performance, MTTR, or error
          values up or down compared to last week? And, if you are investigating
          an issue, comparing aperiod of problemantic performance to a period of{' '}
          <em>normal</em> performance can be very useful.
