          Often, you'll want to determine the "Top N" values grouped by a
          specific attribute. In NRQL, you do this using <code>FACET</code>. For
          example, here are the slowest <code>Transaction</code> calls observed
          on average, grouped by name. We could describe this as "faceted by
          name".

          By default, a faceted query will return the top 10 results; but you
          can customize how many results are returned with a <code>LIMIT</code>.
          In this example, we will retrieve the top 5 results displayed on a
          line chart with <code>TIMESERIES</code>.

          But maybe you don't want a line chart. Perhaps you'd prefer a list of
          the 20 slowest Transactions. By removing the <code>TIMESERIES</code>,
          we can instead render a bar or pie chart.

          Grouping or "faceting" is important. It allows us to get dimensional
          with our data. Using the <code>FACET</code> keyword is the simplest
          way to do this.

          When applying an aggregation function, we can use <code>FACET</code>{' '}
          to group by an attribute. You can use <em>any</em> attribute, default
          or custom, that reports to event data (just like the{' '}
          <code>WHERE</code> clause). We recommend tagging on custom data to
          your events. This allows you to more easily slice and dice the
          resulting data set.
