        Often, you'll want to determine the "Top N" values grouped by a specific
        attribute. In NRQL, you do this using <code>FACET</code>. For example,
        here are the slowest <code>Transaction</code> calls observed on average,
        grouped by name. We could describe this as "faceted by name".
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction **FACET name** SINCE 1 day ago"
        chartType="bar"
        span="6"
      />
      <p>
        By default, a faceted query will return the top 10 results; but you can
        customize how many results are returned with a <code>LIMIT</code>. In
        this example, we will retrieve the top 5 results displayed on a line
        chart with <code>TIMESERIES</code>.
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction **FACET name** SINCE 3 hours ago **LIMIT 5** TIMESERIES"
        span="6"
      />
      <p>
        But maybe you don't want a line chart. Perhaps you'd prefer a list of
        the 20 slowest Transactions. By removing the <code>TIMESERIES</code>, we
        can instead render a bar or pie chart.
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction **FACET name** SINCE 3 hours ago **LIMIT 20**"
        chartType="bar"
        span="6"
      />
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction **FACET name** SINCE 3 hours ago **LIMIT 20**"
        chartType="pie"
        span="6"
      />
      <p>
        This query compares the quantity of Web transactions, broken down by
        individual applications that report to New Relic:
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT count(\*) FROM Transaction WHERE transactionType='Web' **FACET appName** LIMIT 5 SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES"
        span="12"
      />

      <h2>Lesson Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Grouping or "faceting" is important. It allows us to get dimensional
        with our data. Using the <code>FACET</code> keyword is the simplest way
        to do this.
      </p>

      <p>
        When applying an aggregation function, we can use <code>FACET</code> to
        group by an attribute. You can use <em>any</em> attribute, default or
        custom, that reports to event data (just like the <code>WHERE</code>{' '}
        clause). We recommend tagging on custom data to your events. This allows
        you to more easily slice and dice the resulting data set.
