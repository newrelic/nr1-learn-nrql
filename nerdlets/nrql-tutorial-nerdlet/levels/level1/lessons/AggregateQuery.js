      <p>
        Instead of viewing individual events, you usually want to view
        summarized aggregate data across many events. This is where NRDB shines.
        NRDB can scan billions of events and provide instant, realtime answers
        to questions about your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, each <code>Transaction</code> event has a{' '}
        <code>duration</code> attribute. This attribute represents how many
        seconds the call took to execute. Let's see if we can discover the{' '}
        <code>average</code> duration across all <code>Transaction</code>{' '}
        events:
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT **average(duration)** FROM Transaction "
        span="6"
      />

      <p>
        NRQL has many built-in functions you can use to aggregate event data.
        Common functions you might use include <code>max()</code>,{' '}
        <code>min()</code>, <code>median()</code>, and <code>percentile()</code>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        In the following example, we ask NRDB for the duration of the slowest
        transaction from the last 60 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do this, we will ask NRDB for the <code>max(duration)</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          Note: The default time frame for a query is the last 60 minutes.
        </em>
      </p>
      <SampleQuery nrql="SELECT **max(duration)** FROM Transaction " span="6" />

      <p>
        We now know how long the slowest customer experience in the last 60
        minutes took. Next, let's invert the logic: How long was the fastest
        experience? If we ask NRDB for <code>min(duration)</code> we can find
        out.
      </p>
      <SampleQuery nrql="SELECT **min(duration)** FROM Transaction " span="6" />

      <p>
        As you can see, <code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code> both return
        interesting data points. However, we may also want to perform arithmetic
        on our data. With <code>sum()</code> we can do basic addition on a
        numeric attribute. In this query, we will use a new attribute,{' '}
        <code>databaseCallCount</code>. This attribute counts the number of
        database calls each transaction makes. By summing them we can get the
        total volume of database calls in the default 60 minute time window.
        (This will be 0 if your apps don't talk to a database.)
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT **sum(databaseCallCount)** FROM Transaction "
        span="6"
      />

      <p>
        Finally, you can also count all recorded <code>Transaction</code>{' '}
        events. We do this with <code>count(*)</code>. In this example, we count
        all recorded events for all applications reporting to New Relic APM:
      </p>
      <SampleQuery nrql="SELECT **count(*)** FROM Transaction " span="6" />

      <h2>Lesson Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Now we're doing some really interesting things. We're measuring the
        boundaries of our performance, grouping event data together, and even
        calculating information about our chosen attribute.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've chosen <code>duration</code> and calculated the{' '}
        <code>average</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>min</code>. We learned
        how to <code>sum</code> up numeric attributes and <code>count</code> all
        the events for a time period.
      </p>

      <p>
        Manipulating data like this will help us when we want to present data in
        visualizations, which can assist us in spotting performance issues.
