          So far, we've made queries that pull data from a single source. But
          what if you want to plot 2 data points that are stored as two
          different event types? Querying NRDB data is not limited to a single
          event type! To query from multiple event types you can include each
          event type seperated by a comma.

          To make this even more useful, the <code>eventType()</code> function
          tells us which event type a record is from. We can use this to control
          our data output. In this example, we see the total number of{' '}
          <em>Transaction</em> and <em>PageView</em> events combined, as well as
          the totals for only <em>Transaction</em> and <em>PageView</em>.

        fallbacknrql="SELECT count(\*) AS 'Combined Events', filter(count(*), **WHERE eventType() = 'NrdbQuery'**) as 'NrdbQuery', filter(count(*), WHERE eventType()='NrDailyUsage') as 'NrDailyUsage' FROM NrdbQuery, NrDailyUsage SINCE 1 day ago"

          Let's look at this in more detail: <code>count(*)</code> is the total
          number of both <em>Transaction</em> and <em>PageView</em> events.
          However, we can use the aggregator function <code>filter()</code> we
          recently learned about to do something unique. We tell it{' '}
          <code>WHERE eventType()='PageView'</code>. This invokes the filter
          function to observe the event type as part of the total result set,
          then filter to display only those specific events. We can even add{' '}
          <code>TIMESERIES</code> to visualize 2 directly comparable data points
          on a line graph.

        fallbacknrql="SELECT count(\*) AS 'Combined Events', filter(count(\*), WHERE eventType() = 'NrdbQuery') as 'NrdbQuery', filter(count(\*), WHERE eventType()='NrDailyUsage') as 'NrDailyUsage' FROM NrdbQuery, NrDailyUsage SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES max"

          We have managed to locate, return, and graph data from two different
          event types. This is an example of how NRQL can allow you to navigate
          any necessary data quickly and succinctly; no complex joining or join
          statements required!
