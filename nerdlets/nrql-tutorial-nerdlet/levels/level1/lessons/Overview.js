          NRQL stands for <strong>New Relic Query Language</strong>. It gives
          you real-time access to petabytes of Metric, Event, Log, and Trace
          data in NRDB.

          New Relic One's Telemetry Data Platform allows you to query many sets
          of data quickly and easily. For the sake of convenience, examples in
          this tutorial use APM transaction data, because most New Relic
          customers will have this type of data.
          <br />
          <em>
            Note: If you have access to more than one account, please switch to
            an account using APM. If none of your accounts have APM data, we
            will use fallback queries. This may mean the lesson references the
            Transaction table, however the query may use another NR event to
            showcase a similar query.

          You can try every query in this tutorial for yourself, on your own
          data, using the Chart Builder. This allows you to test what you learn
          against real live data reporting to your account. Just click the 'Try
          this query' link beneath any example query to have a go!
