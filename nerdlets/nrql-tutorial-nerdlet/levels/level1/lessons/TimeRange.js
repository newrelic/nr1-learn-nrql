          Every piece of data in NRDB has a <code>timestamp</code>. And every
          query operates on a subset of data within a time range. If you don't
          provide a time range in your NRQL query, it will return the last 60
          minutes by default. We saw this in the previous lesson. But what if we
          want to see data from a different time range? How do we control the
          window of data we see?

          Fortunately, it's very straightforward. Use <code>SINCE</code> and{' '}
          <code>UNTIL</code> keywords to provide a beginning and end to your
          query's time range.

        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P3">
          It's also easy to specify time ranges relative to <em>now</em>. You
          can do this with keywords like <code>day</code>, <code>week</code>,{' '}
          <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code>, or their plural equivalents.
          There are also logical expressions like <code>SINCE today</code> or{' '}
          <code>SINCE this week</code>.

          Here are some sample queries that demonstrate relative time ranges.
          Note that when specifying a relative time, you need to include the
          keyword <code>ago</code>.

          We're getting further control of our data now. Adding a time frame to
          a query lets us define exactly which window of data we want to see.

          These controls let us zero in on the data of interest by defining
          where the data should start and end. In our examples, we saw that we
          can easily choose the window and use common terms like{' '}
          <code>week</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>,{' '}
          <code>minute</code>, and their plurals. You can even use{' '}
          <code>month</code> and <code>year</code> if you're storing that much
          data in New Relic.
