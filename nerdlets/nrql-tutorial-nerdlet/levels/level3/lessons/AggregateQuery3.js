          New Relic offers many different aggregation abilities. Each function
          serves a different, useful purpose. In this lesson, we will explore
          how to use Rate, Funnels, Filter, Histograms, and Apdex aggregation to
          answer more advanced questions.

      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P2">
          Let's start with the <code>rate()</code> function. It allows you to
          visualize the frequency of events over time. This is helpful when you
          want to understand the frequency of events in small periods of time
          within larger time windows.{' '}

          {' '}
          In the example below, we display the average frequency of requests per
          5 minutes for the last hour. We compare this to the previous hourâ€™s
          5-minute average frequency. Notice the query uses{' '}
          <code>SINCE 1 hour ago</code>, this is the overall time window in
          which we are calculating the rate.

      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P4">
          You can use <code>rate()</code> to calculate{' '}
          <em>requests per minute</em> or <em>requests per second</em> by
          setting the time interval to either 1 minute or 1 second.

      </h2>
      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P5">
          Many New Relic customers use funnel charts to understand end-user
          behavior. Funnel charts track the occurrence of an attribute value
          across multiple records. They are commonly used to visualize how
          successfully users' progress through defined paths, and are especially
          powerful when using custom attributes.
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P6">
          Here we use the <code>funnel()</code> aggregator function to visualize
          how many users visit the home page, then proceed to another page. The
          first parameter is the identifying attribute for the unique entries
          we're counting. In this case, New Relic Browser assigns and retains a{' '}
          <code>session</code> ID attribute for each user on your site (subject
          to cookies being enabled). You can also set your own session ID using
          custom attributes.
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P7">
          The remaining parameters determine how each step of the funnel is
          calculated. They are written in the format "
          <code>, WHERE attr OP value</code>". In this case, we provide two: we
          want to know how many user sessions visited the homepage, then also
          how many of these also navigated to other pages.{' '}

      <h2>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.H3">Aggregator Filters</Trans>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P8">
          <code>filter()</code> is a powerful tool that allows you to aggregate
          multiple data points in a single query, offering more control over
          which events are included in function results. In this example, we use{' '}
          <code>filter()</code> to return the separate values for total
          transactions, total web transactions, and total non-web transactions:
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT count(\*) as 'All Transactions', **filter(count(\*), WHERE transactionType = 'Web') as 'Web Transactions'**, filter(count(\*), WHERE transactionType !='Web') as 'Non-Web Transactions' FROM Transaction SINCE 24 hours ago"
        fallbacknrql="SELECT count(\*) AS 'All Transactions', **filter(count(*), WHERE awsAPI = 'dynamodb') AS 'DynamoDB'**, filter(count(*), WHERE awsAPI = 'sqs') AS 'SQS' FROM Public_APICall SINCE 1 day ago"
        span="12"
      />

      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P9">
          Since it returns a number, you can also perform math on its results.
          For example, we can divide total web transactions by all transactions
          to determine what percent of transaction were web transactions:
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT (filter(count(\*), where transactionType = 'Web') **/ count(\*)) \* 100**  as 'Percent web' FROM Transaction SINCE 24 hours ago"
        fallbacknrql="SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE awsAPI = 'dynamodb') **/ count(*)** AS 'Percent of APIs that are DynamoDB' FROM Public_APICall SINCE 1 day ago"
        span="6"
      />

      <h2>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.H4">Histograms</Trans>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P10">
          Histograms allow you to better visualize the distribution of your
          data. This assists in understanding how data points are grouped by
          frequency, not just averages. The <code>histogram()</code> function
          takes three arguments:
          <ol type="1" style={{ 'margin-left': '2em' }}>
            <li>the attribute you want to plot (such as duration)</li>
            <li>
              the maximum value of the range you want to consider (such as "1"
              for 1 second or less)
            </li>
            <li>the number of buckets you want data grouped in</li>
          </ol>
          In our example, we create a <code>histogram()</code> chart for all
          duration values between 0 and 1 second, grouped into 50ms buckets. We
          do this by specifying "20" for the number of buckets. All the
          durations larger than 1 second are grouped together in the last
          bucket.
        </Trans>
      </p>

      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT **histogram(duration, 1, 20)** FROM Transaction SINCE 24 hours ago"
        fallbacknrql="SELECT **histogram(duration, 1, 20)** FROM Public_APICall SINCE 1 day ago"
        chartType="histogram"

      <h2>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.H5">Apdex</Trans>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P11">
          The <code>apdex()</code> function calculates an Apdex score on any
          numerical value (such as duration). You can calculate Apdex for one or
          more specific transactions, account for custom attribute values, and
          even provide your own Apdex-T value without interfering with
          application settings. In this example, we have provided the function
          with an attribute of "duration" and an Apdex-T value of 0.08:
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT **apdex(duration, t: 0.08) as 'Apdex of Duration'** FROM Transaction SINCE 1 week ago"
        fallbacknrql="SELECT apdex(duration, 0.1) AS 'Apdex Of Duration' FROM Public_APICall SINCE 1 week ago"
        span="12"
      />

      <p>
        <Trans i18nKey="Contents.P12">
          We can also add the <code>TIMESERIES</code> operator to chart the data
          over time. Notice this also plots the Apdex satisifed, tolerated, and
          frustrated thresholds.
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) as 'Apdex of Duration' FROM Transaction SINCE 1 week ago **TIMESERIES**"
        fallbacknrql="SELECT apdex(duration, 0.1) AS 'Apdex Of Duration' FROM Public_APICall SINCE 1 week ago **TIMESERIES**"

          We just explored a whole new set of visualizations with{' '}
          <code>funnel()</code> and <code>histogram()</code>. We also learned
          how <code>filter()</code> can help us get more specific in queries
          with WHERE clauses, and how <code>rate()</code> can display the rate
          of an attribute over time.

          These queries further advance your NRQL ability. Apdex is an industry
          standard and is applicable in many scenarios. Funnels can track
          progress through desired paths. Histograms visualize the clear
          distribution of the data; and filters let you get super specific with
          your returned values. Next, we will learn about{' '}
