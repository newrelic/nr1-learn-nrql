          We had a gentle introduction to <em>aggregation</em> in Level 1 by
          using <code>count()</code>, <code>average()</code>, <code>sum()</code>
          , <code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code> to transform data in
          meaningful ways. Next we will explore even more powerful
          functionality. In this lesson we will learn how to find and count
          unique values, locate the most recent or oldest entries for an
          attribute, and work with percentages and percentiles.

          In a previous lesson we learned how the <code>count()</code> function
          can return a simple count of available records. To determine the
          number of unique values recorded for an attribute over a specified
          time range, we can use the <code>uniqueCount()</code> function. In
          this function, we provide the attribute we want to inspect as an
          argument. For instance, here we display all the unique hosts:

          To return the actual list of unique values for an attribute over a

      <SampleQuery

          To retrieve the most recent value of an attribute over a specified
          time range, use the <code>latest()</code> function. In this sample
          query, we are locating the most recent response time for a web
          transaction in the last day. This could help us locate the latest
          value for an intermittently reporting transaction or service.

          Using the <code>earliest()</code> function will do the opposite; that
          is, it will return the <em>earliest</em> value of an attribute
          recorded in the specified time range. In this sample query, we
          retrieve the earliest response time for a web transaction in the last
          day. If data is consistently reporting, this will simply be the data
          point from the earliest event 24 hours ago.

          There may also be scenarios in which you need percentages instead of
          counts, sums, or averages. Using the <code>percentage()</code>{' '}
          function allows you to calculate the percentage of a value in the data
          set that matches a specified condition. This function takes two
          arguments: the first is an aggregator function for your desired
          attribute, such as <code>count()</code>. The second is a{' '}
          <code>WHERE</code> condition to specify the subset of data you'd like
          to query.

          As you can see, aggregation can manipulate data in powerful ways. We
          used <code>uniqueCount()</code> to count the unique entries of a
          particular attribute. But you could also use this to identify a count
          of unique machines, reporting containers, or even how many custom data
          points are sent to New Relic. And, if we want to know what unique
          values are available to query, we can always ask for a list using{' '}
          <code>uniques()</code>.{' '}

          The <code>latest()</code>/<code>earliest()</code> functions are
          particularly useful when dealing with sparse data, or investigating
          when something began or stopped reporting (assuming the data is still
          stored in New Relic).

          We also learned that <code>percentage()</code> can determine what
          percentage of events matched a qualifier compared with the overall

          Finally, we saw how to observe percentiles. For example, you can use{' '}
          <code>percentile()</code> as a Key Performance Indictator by setting a
