          Discovering Events and Attributes can help both answer questions about
          your available data before querying it, and assist with automation!
          Let's take a moment to explore this powerful utility.

          Let's say you want a list of all event types currently reporting to
          your New Relic account. The <code>SHOW EVENT TYPES</code> syntax
          returns a list of all reported event types in a given period. This is
          one of the rare exceptions where <code>SELECT</code> and{' '}
          <code>FROM</code> are not required in a NRQL query. You could use this
          functionality for things like confirming the existence of custom event
          data, for example.

          You may need to know what attributes are available for a given event
          type. The <code>keyset()</code> function provides a list of all
          attributes for an event type, grouped by attribute type. Note that
          only attributes that contain values within the provided time window
          will be returned. You can use this to explore your data. You can also
          use it in automation, for things like ensuring customer data is
          reporting correctly.

          These features help you discovery of changes in event types and/or
          attributes. More DevOps engineers use these functionalities to wrap up
          jobs, or even quickly automate them.
