          A time series query breaks the data into a number of buckets over the
          specified time period. You can have NRDB pick a good default value for
          the width of that bucket, or you can specify your own. Let's ask NRDB
          to show us the average duration of application transactions, with
          returned data organized into 1-hour buckets.

          Notice this returns a flatter graph, since we only have 24 data points
          across the 1-day period being plotted. But what if you want to see the
          maximum possible granularity? Well, any timeseries query can have up
          to 366 data buckets. This means the maximum possible for 24 hours is
          to bucket our data into 4 minute windows. We could calculate it out
          and use <code>TIMESERIES 4 minutes</code>, or we could ask NRDB to
          calculate this for us using <code>TIMESERIES MAX</code>:
